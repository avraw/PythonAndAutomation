#Notes from Automating the Boring Stuff


** exponent
// -> Integer Division
Precedence

The ** operator is evaluated first;
the * , / , // , and % operators are evaluated next, from left to right; 
and the + and - operators are evaluated last (also from left to right).

Example:
>>> 'Alice' * 5
'AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice'

The following line is called a comment.
# This program says hello and asks for my name.

#Input from the user
The input() function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press enter .
myName = input()
This function call evaluates to a string equal to the user’s text, 
and the previous line of code assigns the myName variable to this string value.

#length of a string
You can pass the len() function a string value (or a variable containing a string), 
and the function evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in that string.
print('The length of your name is:')
print(len(myName))

The str() , int() , and float() functions will evaluate to the string, integer, 
and floating-point forms of the value you pass, respectively.


#Examples
>>> 42 == '42'
False
>>> 42 == 42.0
True
>>> 42.0 == 0042.000
True

While
expressions like 4 < 5 aren’t Boolean values, they are expressions that evaluate down to Boolean values.
>>> (4 < 5) and (5 < 6)
True

After any math and comparison operators evaluate, Python evaluates the not operators first, 
then the and operators, and then the or  operators.

When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution immediately jumps back 
to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loop’s condition. 
(This is also what happens when the execution reaches the end of the loop.)

When used in conditions, 0 , 0.0 , and '' (the empty string) are considered False , 
while all other values are considered True .

range(5) results in five iterations through the clause, with i being set to 0 , 
then 1 , then 2 , then 3 , and then 4 . The variable i will go up to, but will not include, the integer passed to range() .

for i in range(12, 16):
print(i)

The first argument will be where the for loop’s variable starts, and the second argument will be up to, 
but not including, the number to stop at.

for i in range(0, 10, 2):
print(i)

The range() function can also be called with three arguments. The first two arguments will be 
the start and stop values, and the third will be the step argument. 
The step is the amount that the variable is increased by after each iteration.

random module, which will give us access
to the random.ranint() function.

print(random.randint(1, 10))

while random.randint(10, 1) causes an error

you can cause the program to terminate, or exit, by
calling the sys.exit() function. Since this function is in the sys module, you have to import sys before your program can use it.


In Python there is a value called None , which represents the absence of a value. 
None is the only value of the NoneType data type. (Other programming languages might call this value null , nil , or undefined .) 
Just like the Boolean True and False values, None must be typed with a capital N.

>>> spam = print('Hello!')
Hello!
>>> None == spam
True

Python adds return None to the end of any function definition with no return statement.

print() function automatically adds a newline character to the end of the string it is passed.

print('Hello', end='')
print('World')
the output would look like this:
HelloWorld

pass multiple string values to print() , the function will automatically separate them with a single space.

print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice')
cats dogs mice

print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice', sep=',')
cats,dogs,mice


Parameters and variables that are assigned in a called function are said to exist in that function’s local scope. 
Variables that are assigned outside all functions are said to exist in the global scope.


There is only one global scope, and it is created when your program begins. 
When your program terminates, the global scope is destroyed, and all its variables are forgotten.

A local scope is created whenever a function is called. Any variables
assigned in this function exist within the local scope. When the function
returns, the local scope is destroyed, and these variables are forgotten. The
next time you call this function, the local variables will not remember the
values stored in them from the last time the function was called.


Scopes matter for several reasons:	
Code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.
However, a local scope can access global variables.
Code in a function’s local scope cannot use variables in any other
local scope.
You can use the same name for different variables if they are in dif-
ferent scopes. That is, there can be a local variable named spam and a
global variable also named spam .

The upshot is that local variables in one function are completely sepa-
rate from the local variables in another function.

That means I can have local variables with the same name in different functions.

If you need to modify a global variable from within a function, use the global
statement.
def spam():
	global eggs
	eggs = 'spam'
eggs = 'global'
spam()
print(eggs)
When you run this program, the final print() call will output this:
spam


There are four rules to tell whether a variable is in a local scope or
global scope:
1. If a variable is being used in the global scope (that is, outside of all
functions), then it is always a global variable.
2. If there is a global statement for that variable in a function, it is a global
variable.
3. Otherwise, if the variable is used in an assignment statement in the
function, it is a local variable.
4. But if the variable is not used in an assignment statement, it is a global
variable.
 

The code that
could potentially have an error is put in a try clause.
and have
an except clause contain code to handle what happens when this error occurs.
def spam(divideBy):
try:
return 42 / divideBy
except ZeroDivisionError:
print('Error: Invalid argument.')

once the execution jumps to the code in the except clause, it does not return to the try
clause. Instead, it just continues moving down as normal.

lists them-
selves can contain other lists, you can use them to
arrange data into hierarchical structures.

>> spam = [['cat', 'bat'], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]]
>>> spam[0]
['cat', 'bat']
>>> spam[0][1]
'bat'
>>> spam[1][4]
50


The integer value -1 refers to the last index in a list, the value -2
refers to the second-to-last index in a list, and so on.
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[-1]
'elephant'

A slice goes up to, but will not
include, the value at the second index.
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[0:4]
['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[:2]
['cat', 'bat']
>>> spam[1:]
['bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> [1, 2, 3] + ['A', 'B', 'C']
[1, 2, 3, 'A', 'B', 'C']
>>> ['X', 'Y', 'Z'] * 3
['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
>>> spam = [1, 2, 3]
>>> spam = spam + ['A', 'B', 'C']
>>> spam
[1, 2, 3, 'A', 'B', 'C']

The del statement will delete values at an index in a list. All of the values
in the list after the deleted value will be moved up one index.
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> del spam[2]
>>> spam
['cat', 'bat', 'elephant']

>>> spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
>>> 'cat' in spam
False
also the not in operator

The Multiple Assignment Trick
>>> cat = ['fat', 'black', 'loud']
>>> size, color, disposition = cat


>>> spam = 'Hello'
>>> spam += ' world!'
>>> spam
'Hello world!'

A method is the same thing as a function, except it is “called on” a value.

List values have an index() method that can be passed a value, and if that
value exists in the list, the index of the value is returned. If the value isn’t
in the list, then Python produces a ValueError error


>>> spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
>>> spam.index('hello')
0

append() method call adds the argument to the end of
the list. The insert() method can insert a value at any index in the list.
The first argument to insert() is the index for the new value, and the sec-
ond argument is the new value to be inserted.


>>> spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']
>>> spam.append('moose')
>>> spam
['cat', 'dog', 'bat', 'moose']

>>> spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']
>>> spam.insert(1, 'chicken')
>>> spam
['cat', 'chicken', 'dog', 'bat']

The remove() method is passed the value to be removed from the list it is
called on. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam.remove('bat')
>>> spam
['cat', 'rat', 'elephant']


>>> spam = [2, 5, 3.14, 1, -7]
>>> spam.sort()
>>> spam
[-7, 1, 2, 3.14, 5]

>>> spam.sort(reverse=True)
>>> spam
['elephants', 'dogs', 'cats', 'badgers', 'ants']

sort() uses “ASCIIbetical order” rather than actual alphabetical
order for sorting strings. This means uppercase letters come before lower-
case letters.

To sort in regular alphabetical order
>>> spam = ['a', 'z', 'A', 'Z']
>>> spam.sort(key=str.lower)
>>> spam
['a', 'A', 'z', 'Z']


You can also split up a single instruction across multiple lines using the \
line continuation character at the end. Think of \ as saying, “This instruction
continues on the next line.” The indentation on the line after a \ line continua-
tion is not significant. For example, the following is valid Python code:
print('Four score and seven ' + \
'years ago...')

Using list functions is Strings
>>> name = 'Zophie'
>>> name[0]
'Z'
>>> name[-2]
'i'
>>> name[0:4]
'Zoph'
>>> 'Zo' in name
True
>>> 'z' in name
False
>>> 'p' not in name
False

But lists and strings are different in an important way. A list value is a mutable
data type: It can have values added, removed, or changed. However, a string
is immutable: It cannot be changed. Trying to reassign a single character in
a string results in a TypeError error

The proper way to “mutate” a string is to use slicing and concatenation
to build a new string by copying from parts of the old string.

Although a list value is mutable, the second line in the following code
does not modify the list eggs :
>>>
>>>
>>>
[4,
eggs = [1, 2, 3]
eggs = [4, 5, 6]
eggs
5, 6]
The list value in eggs isn’t being changed here; rather, an entirely new
and different list value ( [4, 5, 6] ) is overwriting the old list value ( [1, 2, 3] ).

If you wanted to actually modify the original list in eggs to contain
[4, 5, 6] , you would have to do something like this:
eggs = [1, 2, 3]
del eggs[2]
del eggs[1]
del eggs[0]
eggs.append(4)
eggs.append(5)
eggs.append(6)
eggs
5, 6]

tuples are typed with parentheses, ( and ) , instead of square
brackets, [ and ] .
But the main way that tuples are different from lists is that tuples,
like strings, are immutable. Tuples cannot have their values modified,
appended, or removed.


If you have only one value in your tuple, you can indicate this by placing
a trailing comma after the value inside the parentheses. Otherwise, Python
will think you’ve just typed a value inside regular parentheses. The comma
is what lets Python know this is a tuple value.

>>> type(('hello',))
<class 'tuple'>
>>> type(('hello'))
<class 'str'>

You can use tuples to convey to anyone reading your code that you
don’t intend for that sequence of values to change. If you need an ordered
sequence of values that never changes, use a tuple. A second benefit of
using tuples instead of lists is that, because they are immutable and their
contents don’t change, Python can implement some optimizations that
make code using tuples slightly faster than code using lists.

converting types
>>> tuple(['cat', 'dog', 5])
('cat', 'dog', 5)
>>> list(('cat', 'dog', 5))
['cat', 'dog', 5]
>>> list('hello')
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

When you assign a list to a variable, you
are actually assigning a list reference to the variable. A reference is a value
that points to some bit of data, and a list reference is a value that points to a
list.

>>> spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> cheese = spam
>>> cheese[1] = 'Hello!'
>>> spam
[0, 'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> cheese
[0, 'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]

Python uses references whenever variables must
store values of mutable data types, such as lists or dictionaries. For values
of immutable data types such as strings, integers, or tuples, Python vari-
ables will store the value itself.

When a function is called, the values of the argu-
ments are copied to the parameter variables. For lists and dictionaries this means a copy of the reference
is used for the parameter.

copy.copy() , can be used
to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary, not just a
copy of a reference.

>>> import copy
>>> spam = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
>>> cheese = copy.copy(spam)
>>> cheese[1] = 42
>>> spam
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
>>> cheese
['A', 42, 'C', 'D']

If the list you need to copy contains lists, then use the copy.deepcopy()
function instead of copy.copy() . The deepcopy() function will copy these
inner lists as well.

unlike indexes for
lists, indexes for dictionaries can use many different data types, not just
integers. Indexes for dictionaries are called keys, and a key with its associ-
ated value is called a key-value pair.
In code, a dictionary is typed with braces, {} .

>>> myCat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'disposition': 'loud'}
>>> myCat['size']
'fat'
>>> 'My cat has ' + myCat['color'] + ' fur.'
'My cat has gray fur.'

Using the keys() , values() , and items() methods, a for loop can iterate
over the keys, values, or key-value pairs in a dictionary, respectively. Notice
that the values in the dict_items value returned by the items() method are
tuples of the key and value.
If you want a true list from one of these methods, pass its list-like return
value to the list() function. Enter the following into the interactive shell:

>>> spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}
>>> spam.keys()
dict_keys(['color', 'age'])
>>> list(spam.keys())
['color', 'age']

You can also use the multiple assignment trick in a for loop to assign
the key and value to separate variables. Enter the following into the inter­
active shell:
>>> spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}
>>> for k, v in spam.items():
print('Key: ' + k + ' Value: ' + str(v))
Key: age Value: 42
Key: color Value: red


>>> spam = {'name': 'Zophie', 'age': 7}
>>> 'name' in spam.keys()
True
>>> 'Zophie' in spam.values()
True


dictionaries have a get() method that takes two
arguments: the key of the value to retrieve and a fallback value to return if
that key does not exist.

>>> picnicItems = {'apples': 5, 'cups': 2}
>>> 'I am bringing ' + str(picnicItems.get('cups', 0)) + ' cups.'
'I am bringing 2 cups.'
>>> 'I am bringing ' + str(picnicItems.get('eggs', 0)) + ' eggs.'
'I am bringing 0 eggs.'

The setdefault() method offers a way to do this in one line of code. The
first argument passed to the method is the key to check for, and the second
argument is the value to set at that key if the key does not exist. If the key
does exist, the setdefault() method returns the key’s value. Enter the follow-
ing into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = {'name': 'Pooka',
>>> spam.setdefault('color',
'black'
>>> spam
{'color': 'black', 'age': 5,
>>> spam.setdefault('color',
'black'
>>> spam
{'color': 'black', 'age': 5,
'age': 5}
'black')
'name': 'Pooka'}
'white')
'name': 'Pooka'}

If you import the pprint module into your programs, you’ll have access to
the pprint() and pformat() functions that will “pretty print” a dictionary’s
values. This is helpful when you want a cleaner display of the items in a
dictionary than what print() provides. Modify the previous characterCount.py
program and save it as prettyCharacterCount.py.
import pprint
message = 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking
thirteen.'
count = {}
for character in message:
count.setdefault(character, 0)
count[character] = count[character] + 1
pprint.pprint(count)


>>> spam = 'Say hi to Bob\'s mother.'
Python knows that since the single quote in Bob\'s has a backslash, it
is not a single quote meant to end the string value. The escape characters
\' and \" let you put single quotes and double quotes inside your strings,
respectively.

Escape character Prints as
\' Single quote
\" Double quote
\t Tab
\n Newline (line break)
\\ Backslash


You can place an r before the beginning quotation mark of a string to make
it a raw string. A raw string completely ignores all escape characters and
prints any backslash that appears in the string.
>>> print(r'That is Carol\'s cat.')
That is Carol\'s cat.


Any quotes,
tabs, or newlines in between the “triple quotes” are considered part of the
string. Python’s indentation rules for blocks do not apply to lines inside a
multiline string.

print('''Dear Alice,
Eve's cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burglary, and extortion.
Sincerely,
Bob''')
Save this program as catnapping.py and run it. The output will look
like this:
Dear Alice,
Eve's cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burglary, and extortion.
Sincerely,
Bob

def spam():
"""This is a multiline comment to help
explain what the spam() function does."""
print('Hello!')



upper(), lower(), isupper(), and islower() String Methods

isalpha() returns True if the string consists only of letters and is not blank.
isalnum() returns True if the string consists only of letters and numbers
and is not blank.
isdecimal() returns True if the string consists only of numeric characters
and is not blank.
isspace() returns True if the string consists only of spaces, tabs, and new-
lines and is not blank.
istitle() returns True if the string consists only of words that begin with
an uppercase letter followed by only lowercase letters.

The startswith() and endswith() methods return True if the string value they
are called on begins or ends (respectively) with the string passed to the
method; otherwise, they return False .

>>> ', '.join(['cats', 'rats', 'bats'])
'cats, rats, bats'
>>> ' '.join(['My', 'name', 'is', 'Simon'])
'My name is Simon'
>>> 'ABC'.join(['My', 'name', 'is', 'Simon'])
'MyABCnameABCisABCSimon'

>>> 'My name is Simon'.split()
['My', 'name', 'is', 'Simon']
>>> 'MyABCnameABCisABCSimon'.split('ABC')
['My', 'name', 'is', 'Simon']
>>> 'My name is Simon'.split('m')
['My na', 'e is Si', 'on']

The rjust() and ljust() string methods return a padded version of the
string they are called on, with spaces inserted to justify the text. The first
argument to both methods is an integer length for the justified string.
Enter the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Hello'.rjust(10)
'
Hello'
>>> 'Hello'.rjust(20)
'
Hello'
>>> 'Hello World'.rjust(20)
'
Hello World'
>>> 'Hello'.ljust(10)
'Hello
'

>>> 'Hello'.center(20)
'
Hello
'
>>> 'Hello'.center(20, '=')
'=======Hello========'

The lstrip() and rstrip() methods
will remove whitespace characters from the left and right ends, respectively.

The pyperclip module has copy() and paste() functions that can send text
to and receive text from your computer’s clipboard. Sending the output of
your program to the clipboard will make it easy to paste it to an email, word
processor, or some other software.
Pyperclip does not come with Python. To install it, follow the directions
for installing third-party modules in Appendix A. After installing the
pyperclip module, enter the following into the interactive shell:
>>> import pyperclip
>>> pyperclip.copy('Hello world!')
>>> pyperclip.paste()
'Hello world!'
